# Radharani Jewellery ERP

Internal stock-audit ERP + read-only ecommerce catalog for Radharani Jewellery Works. The core problem is tamper-evident tracking of physical stock (vault, counter, karigars, hallmarking, customers) — this is not primarily an online store.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Never `UPDATE` or `DELETE` a `movements`, `sales`, or `purchases` row — corrections are new rows referencing the original, approved by an owner. The one narrow exception, matching the schema's own design: `sales.confirmed_by_accountant` and a movement's `approved_by` column may be set once, by an admin, as part of the verification/review flows described below — nothing else on those rows ever changes.
2. Never store a calculated price, except `sale_items.price_at_sale` (a deliberate snapshot at time of sale).
3. Every write needs a real `user_id` — no anonymous or shared-login actions.
4. Photos go through `PhotoCompressionService` — never save an upload directly.
5. New slow/async work goes through the queue (`database` driver) — never the request cycle.
6. New modules convert their matching wireframe in `resources/views/wireframes/` where one exists — several newer modules (Exchange, Refinery, Orders, Notifications, Loyalty, Installments) have no matching wireframe (they emerged after the original 13 were approved) and instead follow `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.
7. Staff (`users`) and customers (`customers`) are two entirely separate auth systems (different guards) — never merge them. Staff log in with email **or phone** (`users.phone`); customers log in with phone only.
8. A full-page Livewire component's Blade view must **never** wrap itself in `<x-layouts.app>`/`<x-layouts.guest>`. Set the layout from PHP instead: `return view('livewire.x.y', [...])->layout('components.layouts.app', ['title' => '...']);`. See "The Livewire double-layout trap" below — getting this wrong silently breaks every button/form on the page.
9. Items returning from karigar or hallmarking sit in `items.status = 'pending_review'` until an admin confirms them via the Pending Review queue (`movement.approve` permission) — never write them straight back to `in_stock`.
10. A sale is not final until an admin verifies it. On entry, sold items get `items.status = 'reserved'`, not `'sold'`; the Sale Verification Queue is what flips them to `'sold'` and sets `sales.confirmed_by_accountant`.

## Stack

- Laravel 13 (PHP 8.4), Blade + Livewire — no separate frontend framework, no API layer
- Tailwind CSS (the "Aurum" design system, see `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`) — Alpine.js is provided by Livewire itself (`@livewireStyles`/`@livewireScripts` in the shared layouts); `resources/js/app.js` must **not** import/start its own copy of Alpine — see the trap below.
- MySQL 8+, database-driven queue (no Redis), local disk storage with WebP-compressed photos (no S3)
- Hosting: Hostinger shared plan — SSH + cron + phpMyAdmin only, no VPS, 20GB storage
- Auth: Laravel Breeze (blade stack); `spatie/laravel-permission`, `spatie/laravel-activitylog`, `intervention/image`
- Designed to swap infra later via config only (`local`→`s3`, `database`→`redis` queue) — never a rebuild

## Stock module conventions

- **Regrouping is history.** `Item`, `Packet` and `Box` log changes via `spatie/laravel-activitylog` (log name `stock`); `StockHistoryService` merges those with `movements`, sales and QR scans into the Item/Packet/Box Detail timelines. So always move things with a per-model `->update(['packet_id' => ...])` / `->update(['box_id' => ...])`. A mass `Item::whereIn(...)->update(...)` bypasses model events and silently drops the move from history.
- **QR stickers** (`QrCode`) encode `route('stock.qr.resolve', $code)`; resolving logs a `scanned` activity and redirects to the detail page. `QrCode::forTarget()` reuses an existing code rather than minting a second one. SVGs are rendered by `chillerlan/php-qrcode` (no GD needed); print sheets are at `stock.qr.print?ids=...`.
- **Scanner input** goes through `App\Support\StockLookup`, which accepts HUIDs, internal codes, packet/box codes, sticker codes and full scan URLs. Spreadsheets (CSV/XLSX) go through `App\Support\SpreadsheetReader` (`openspout/openspout`).
- **The Add/Edit Item form** is its own component (`Stock\ItemForm`), opened with `Livewire.dispatch('open-item-form', { id })` / `{ purchaseItemId }` and emitting `item-saved`. Don't duplicate it into other pages; embed `<livewire:stock.item-form />`.
- **List pages** use `App\Livewire\Concerns\WithDataTable` with `<x-ui.datatable>` (see `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`).

## The Livewire double-layout trap (read before touching any full-page component)

Every full-page Livewire component (anything bound directly to a route, e.g. `Route::get('/x', SomeComponent::class)`) gets auto-wrapped by Livewire in a layout on **every** request if it doesn't call `->layout()` itself — including AJAX responses for `wire:click`/`wire:submit`. If the component's own Blade view *also* wraps its content in `<x-layouts.app>` (a full `<html>`/`<head>`/`<body>` document), every interactive action returns an entire second HTML document as the morph payload, which breaks the page (it goes blank) after literally any button click. This exact bug shipped for a while — every full-page component was self-wrapping and had zero working interactions beyond the initial page load.

**The fix, and the only correct pattern going forward:**
- Blade view: no `<x-layouts.app>`/`<x-layouts.guest>` wrapper — just the inner `<div>...</div>`.
- PHP class: `render()` ends with `->layout('components.layouts.app', ['title' => '...'])` (or `components.layouts.guest` for portal/guest pages that don't already call `->layout('components.layouts.guest')` explicitly, like the Customer Portal components do).

Plain **non-Livewire** pages (a regular Controller returning `view(...)`, e.g. `auth/login.blade.php`, `welcome.blade.php`) are the one place `<x-layouts.app>`/`<x-layouts.guest>` self-wrapping is still correct — there's no Livewire auto-layout involved for those.

## Alpine.js trap

Livewire v3 bundles its own copy of Alpine and unconditionally sets `window.Alpine` when its script runs. If `resources/js/app.js` *also* `import`s and starts a separate `alpinejs` package copy, you get two competing Alpine instances ("Detected multiple instances of Alpine running" in the console) and `x-data` elements stop reacting to `wire:model` correctly. `resources/js/app.js` must stay Alpine-free. Every page still gets Alpine via `@livewireStyles`/`@livewireScripts`, which are included directly in `components/layouts/app.blade.php` and `components/layouts/guest.blade.php` (safe to include even on pages with no actual Livewire component — Livewire won't double-inject if a real component is also present).

## Environment setup traps (easy to reintroduce on a fresh clone)

1. `bootstrap/app.php` needs Spatie's middleware aliases manually added (Laravel 11+ removed `Kernel.php`) — already applied there; reapply if it goes missing.
2. `config/auth.php` needs the `customer` guard/provider/passwords block — see `config/auth-additions.md`.
3. `composer require laravel/breeze` alone does nothing — must also run `php artisan breeze:install blade`.
4. Portal Livewire components must use `->layout('components.layouts.guest')`, never Breeze's default — that default assumes a staff login and crashes on any guest/customer page.
5. The `jobs`/`job_batches`/`failed_jobs` tables aren't part of any business migration — easy to forget, breaks the queue silently until first dispatch.
6. `public/storage` must be a symlink to `storage/app/public` on **this machine** (`php artisan storage:link`) — it silently breaks (points at a stale path) if the project directory is ever moved or cloned somewhere new.
7. Time is **IST everywhere**: `config/app.php` timezone defaults to `Asia/Kolkata` (`APP_TIMEZONE`) and the MySQL session is set to `+05:30` (`DB_TIMEZONE`) so `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` defaults agree. Don't reintroduce `'UTC'`. Rows written before 25 Sep 2026 were stored as UTC and display 5h30m early; they were deliberately not rewritten because `movements`/`sales`/`purchases` are insert-only.
8. After a fresh clone/migrate, run `php artisan db:seed --class=DemoDataSeeder` (local/testing environments only — it's gated out of anything else) to get realistic test data across every module instead of empty screens.
